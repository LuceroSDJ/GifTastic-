Data is provided by GIPHY API to create a dynamic web page using JavaScript and jQuery

## Nowadays, some of us rely on emojis to express our feelings when we send text messages, and we love emojis! They add fun and color to our communication!

## Well, now you can explore this awesome app to generate gifs representing the emojis! 
## Emojis + Gifs = tons of FUN! ðŸ˜‰

### GIPHY API supports emojis across Search, Translate, and Random endpoints! And in this app we use Search endpoint.
### By clicking on the buttons with emojis in them, we are triggering an AJAX call and hitting the awesome GIPHY API.
### As a result, we get 10 still gifs representing the emotion of our expressive emoji.
### Lastly, you get to click on the gifs to animate or stop them.
